            <p>
                My name is Polina Grabar.
                <br/>
                I'm a computer science student based in Izhevsk, Russia. I'm also working part-time as a programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm mostly interested in programming languages and everything related to them - things like
                translators, compilers, DSLs, markup languages, etc.
            </p>

                Programming
            </h5>

            <p>
                Right now I'm working mainly with <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Laravel</strong>, and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lately I've also been using <strong>Python</strong> a lot. I mostly use it in my
                final project, but also in various labs, algorithmic challenges and random scripts.
            </p>

            <p>
                I consider my "native" language to be <strong>C#</strong>. While I haven't really been writing
                C# code lately, in the past I've used it for pretty much every single university project. I also have
                a couple of pet projects written in C#, including <a href="https://github.com/Jackeeet/warbler">a simple interpreted programming language</a>.
                I'm also familiar with other .NET tech, including <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong>, <strong>EF</strong>
                and unit-testing frameworks like <strong>NUnit</strong>. Eventually I'm probably going to learn F# as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also use <strong>JavaScript</strong> quite a bit. I'm very comfortable with vanilla JS, and
                I know the basics of <strong>React</strong>. Frontend is not really my cup of tea, but I can create a
                simple web interface without any problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I have some free time, I write <strong>Haskell</strong> programs for fun.
                I've written some code in <strong>assembly, ะก++,</strong> and <strong>Java</strong> as well.
                <br/>
                And finally, I'm technically the world's most experienced
                <a href="https://github.com/Jackeeet/warbler">warbler</a> programmer :)
                So I'll be able to pick up any new language/framework if necessary.
            </p>

                I try my best to reply to emails and telegram messages as soon as possible. It might take me a bit more time to reply through VK, because I don't spend too much time there.
